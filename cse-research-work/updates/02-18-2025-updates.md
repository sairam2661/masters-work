Current:

- workflow
  ![Overall Idea](../assets/workflow_fuzzing.png)
  - able to get consistent runs, but still feels slow
  - (for JS) outputs are poor; spec grammar/prompt needs to be better?
  - what examples do we consider for few-shot learning?
- setup JS Engine on server

Next:

- continue working on fuzzing pipeline
- get consistent runs; collect data
- evaluate against other SOTA fuzzers
