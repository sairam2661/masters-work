**Context:** I'm working on using constrained decoding for fuzzing structured data formats.

**Current:**

- completed ASAP experiments on XML/SQL benchmarks
- modeling GCD for directed-greybox fuzzing as a search problem, using distance as the fitness function
  - reading WAFLGoâ€™s critical-code guidance and masking mechanism

**Next:**

- prototype a sampler to minimize distance to a specified target site
