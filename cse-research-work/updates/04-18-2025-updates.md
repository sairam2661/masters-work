**Context:** I'm working on using constrained decoding for fuzzing structured data formats.

**Current:**

- Integrating instrumented libxml2 and Lua targets from Magma benchmark into testing pipeline
- Alternatives to afl-tmin for minimizing corpus?

**Next:**

- Complete evaluation against Magma benchmark suite
