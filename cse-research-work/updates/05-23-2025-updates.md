**Context:** I'm working on using constrained decoding for fuzzing structured data formats.

**Current:**

- Drafting proposal; comparing two approaches:
  - Target-directed fuzzing – integrate AFLGo-style distance metrics into sampling.
  - Adaptive – use other feedback (e.g., coverage, edge hits) to _adjust_ weights during fuzzing (Pythia (API), CovRL (JS)).
- Reading current work in this space (AFLGo, Pythia, CovRL)

**Next:**

- Finalize direction and discuss proposal.
- Run ASAp experiments for XML/SQL benchmarks.
