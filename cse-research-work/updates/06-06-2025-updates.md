**Context:** I'm working on using constrained decoding for fuzzing structured data formats.

**Current:**

- Completed WAFLGo setup, resolving build and configuration issues so the default pipeline now runs.

  - (WAFLGo is a directed greybox fuzzer that uses critical‐code guidance to steer mutations toward specific target sites.)

  **Next:**

- Integrate LLM based input generation with WAFLGo’s feedback loop (drive generation by distance-to-target information).
