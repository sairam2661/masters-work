**Context:** I'm working on using constrained decoding with feedback-driven fuzzing to generate valid test inputs.

**Current:**

- Finished setting up instrumented fuzzing of libxml2 with AFL++
- Working on feedback-driven mutation strategy using AFL++ metrics
  - Identify best mutation strategies and high-value test cases from corpus
- Decent throughput (3000+ executions/sec) and coverage over ~2 hour run

**Next:**

- Run against Magma benchmark for XML and compare w/ other fuzzers
