Current:

- read about constrainted-decoding and fuzzing
- experiment with Grammarinator and Reflexion
- tools/approaches covered -> Grammarinator, TestChain, LLAMAFUZZ, Gramatron, AFL++, LibFuzzer.
- metrics for evaluation

Next:

- how do we integrate constrained decoding with fuzzing?
- finish reviewing tools/current trends
