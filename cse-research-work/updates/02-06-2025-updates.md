Current:

- collect benchmarks for testing gramar-based fuzzing
- setup `transformers-GAD` in CSE servers
- write lark grammars from collected benchmarks, and test w/ above

Next:

- read on _Grammar_-based fuzzing
- extracting grammars from given input (vs generators)
- setup a proof of concept fuzzing pipeline with Magma
- compare metrics against LLAMAFuzz, Gramatron
