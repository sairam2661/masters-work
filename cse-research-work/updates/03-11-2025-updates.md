Current:

- haven't covered much due to finals week
- set up AFL++ (for mutation-based fuzzing using LLM seeds)
- run end-to-end test for XML (~1 hour)
  - measure total outputs, coverage, diversity vs. libxml2
  - compare throughput w/ FormatFuzzer, G2Fuzz

Next:

- expand to JSON, YAML, JavaScript (1-hour runs)
- refine pipeline, set up longer runs, collect data
